    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improved performance: Multithreading can improve performance by allowing different parts of the program to run in parallel. This can be especially useful for programs that involve time-consuming operations, such as I/O or calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Better resource utilization: Multithreading can help to better utilize system resources, such as CPU time and memory. By dividing the work among multiple threads, a program can use resources more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhanced responsiveness: Multithreading can help to make a program more responsive to user input. By running time-consuming tasks in the background on separate threads, the main thread can continue to respond to user actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplified code: In some cases, multithreading can simplify the code of a program by allowing complex tasks to be split into simpler, smaller tasks that can be executed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increased complexity: Multithreading can make a program more complex, as it requires careful synchronization and communication between threads. This can lead to issues such as deadlocks, race conditions, and other synchronization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Difficult debugging: Multithreaded programs can be difficult to debug, as issues can be hard to reproduce and diagnose. Problems can also occur due to the non-deterministic behavior of threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increased memory usage: Multithreading can increase memory usage, as each thread requires its own stack space and memory for synchronization and communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Difficulty in implementation: Implementing multithreaded code can be difficult, especially for developers who are not familiar with the concepts of thread safety, synchronization, and parallel programming."

This situation can occur when multiple threads hold locks on resources and are waiting for other threads to release their locks. Deadlocks can result in a program freezing or becoming unresponsive, and they can be difficult to debug and resolve.\n",

If the threads access the counter variable concurrently, it's possible for them to read the same value, and then increment it and write it back, resulting in only one increment being applied instead of two.
